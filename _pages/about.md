<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2> 
I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor and researcher at [Great Bay University (GBU)](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/). Previously, I was a senior engineer at Huawei (Hangzhou, China). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Chang YANG](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/index.html) in 2022. Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree in computer science from South China University of Technology in 2018. 


<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2> 
I am interested in the problem of data storage, including storage systems, memory systems, database systems and data infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.
